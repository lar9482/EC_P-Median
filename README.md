Taught by [Dr. Roger Wainwright](https://engineering.utulsa.edu/computer-science/faculty/profile/roger-wainwright/) in SP 2023.

Experiments with the following techniques to solve the P-Median problem.
  - A simple genetic algorithm
    - Roulette, Rank, and Tournament selection
    - Single-Point, Double-Point, and Uniform crossover
    - Simple and Hyperheuristic mutation
    
  - A simulated annealing algorithm.
    - Simple and Hyperheuristic perbutation.
    
  - A foolish hill climbing algorithm.
